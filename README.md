# Neutron

A unity framework for creating multiplayer games, Neutron was created with very high performance in mind.

With high performance in mind, Neutron has become limited to Unity version 2021.2 or newer. 
Why? Because in version 2021.2 or newer, Unity added Support for .Net Standard 2.1. With the new .NET came improvements to the Network Socket and other new features such as Span, Memory, ArrayPool....etc

So I decided to take advantage of the new features to create a high-performance networking framework.

Documentation: Coming Soon....
